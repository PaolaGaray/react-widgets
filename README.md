This is an application that includes multiple components using Hooks in React. The goal is to practice and building my knowlegde on that. What I implemented is an app that has a couple of different widgets put toguether as a little reusable components. These are five separate pages that don't have a direct connection to each other:
 
- An Accordion component: it is using setState().

- A Wikipedia API search component: Little widget to show how to do a search and show some results. It is using the hooks useState() and useEffect().

- A Dropdown item selection component: useState(), useEffect() and useRef()

- A Google Translate API component: finally, this is a widget identical to a language translator app. It is using the hooks useState(), useEffect() and useRef().
